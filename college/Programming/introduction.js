/*

Computer store date -> 1 and 0 -> bit -> eight digits is a byte

1 byte = 8 bits

1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes

1 megabyte = 1024 kilobytes

1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes

1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes

1 character = 1 byte (8 bits)


How program works

fetch
decode
execute

Type of programming languages

Low level language -> machine code
    machine languages -> binary
    assembly languages -> assembly code

High level language -> human readable


Keywords, operators and syntax

    Keywords -> reserved words -> string, int, private
    Operators -> +, -, *, /, %
    Syntax -> rules of a programming language
    statement -> complete instruction that performs some action

Compilers and interpreters

    Compiler -> translates code into machine code (binary)-> all at once
    
    Interpreter -> translates one instruction at a time

User -> Person using the computer

GUI -> Graphical User Interface

    Console Application -> text based interface (Command Line Interface)
    Form Application -> User interacts with the program through a form
        event-driven programming -> user interacts with the program through events
    Controls -> buttons, textBoxes, labels, etc -> objects -> Enable user to interact with the program
    Invisible controls -> timer, etc -> help to make the program work don't display anything to the user

The .NET Framework

    Framework -> collection of classes and methods that help us to create applications

Homework

    Install Visual Studio -> course setup, install and customize
    Watch video -> Why learn programming?
    Research -> What is an integer -> discussion no submission required
